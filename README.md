Java Application Developer Assessment


Business Requirement
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each valid purchase. A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction (e.g. if one customer spends $120 total in a transaction, then points earned is 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given all the transactions of every customer during a period of time(1 year for example), calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
Solution Requirement
●	Create some Restful APIs to get customer's reward points. By customized input like user id or user name.
●	Use common sense to make assumptions.
●	Consider the API security and confidentiality of user data.
●	Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution.
●	The solution should demonstrate the design of API, business logic and data storage.
●	Use SpringBoot 2 or 3.
●	Frontend is not required, but the solution should include instructions of how to build, run and validate the result.
●	The solution should be independently executed without any external dependencies like DB and APIs. Embedded DB is allowed.
●	Should have proper Unit test cases.
●	Code should be shared via github link using a public repository .
